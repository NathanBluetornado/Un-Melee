This file contains each HUD element used in Un-Melee (mostly meters)

They're hooked into the stage via the code, and controlled there too.

All of these files have their own matanims (material animations) to show how full the meters are.
The only exceptions are "Random_Scene_Models" because it's just the dice indicator, and gear when that is added.
These remain static additions to the hud so they don't need their own animations.

The Meters.dat file is absolutely necessary to this mod. In older (unreleased) versions, these meters would be 
implemented within the individual stage files themselves, making the mod truly portable, but to allow for more 
storage and a smoother connection that isn't the case anymore.
