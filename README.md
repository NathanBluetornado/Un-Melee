# Un-Melee
The public github repo for the Un-Melee mod

This is my first repo for anything in general, so sorry if it starts out a little messy.
I want people to get a better understanding of how all this coding works as there is isn't much documentation yet,
it isn't perfect but this is what I can contribute to that.

I'd like to give massive thanks to Unclepunch, Janthor, Rapito and Vetri for both helping me out with coding issues, 
and for making some of the code that I built this project from.

You need to install Mextool, Mex-Tk and HSD raw to get anywhere with this, here are the necessary links:

  https://github.com/Ploaj/HSDLib
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/180138eVXqULtTQvc3IXspwlmlT4RnHc6EflYK6KsPGo     (Mextk installation guide)

If you want to add Un-Melee to your build please ask me first, and likewise if you need help with anything here feel free to ask too.
If there are any questions, please message me at bluetornado#5047 on discord
